##vimdiff commands

]c :        - next difference
[c :        - previous difference
do          - diff obtain
dp          - diff put
zo          - open folded text
zc          - close folded text
zr          - open all folds
zm          - close all folds
:diffupdate - re-scan the files for differences


##git mergetool

Middle file = future merged file

In the middle file, navigate between conflicts with ]c and [c.

Choose version to keep with :diffget //2 or :diffget //3
 //2 = target/master copy
 //3 = merge/branch copy

:diffupdate (remove leftover spacing issues)
:only (shows only the middle/merged file once done reviewing all conflicts)
:wq (save and quit)
git add .
git commit -m “Merge resolved”
If you were trying to do a git pull when you ran into merge conflicts, type git rebase –continue.
